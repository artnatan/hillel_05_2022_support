3. .flake8 - `a file with additional settings for the flake8 linter, such as the maximum length of a line of code, exceptions, etc.`
4. pyproject.toml - `intended for configuring black (code formatter) and isort (sorter) utilities by analogy with .flake8`

docker ps -a    - view containers

docker rm 'id'  - delete container by id

docker image prune  - remove none images
```
## Dockerfile
`The sequence of commands for creating an image with the program, the establishment of dependencies and the order of launch, etc.`

WORKDIR     - change working directory

COPY        - copy project file

# Install deps
RUN pip install pipenv \
    && pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile --dev

# Commands: delay (to be in time to complete migrations), migrations, launch
CMD sleep 3 \
    && python manage.py migrate \
    && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
